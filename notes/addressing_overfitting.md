# Addressing Overfitting

There are three major means by which we can addres overfitting:

1. Reduce the number of features
2. Collect more data
3. Regularization

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of the original features to use in the model. This can be done manually, or automatically. There are three main strategies for feature selection:

1. Univariate Statistics
2. Model-Based Selection
3. Iterative Selection

## Collect More Data

Collecting more data is a great way to reduce overfitting. However, this is not always possible. In these cases, regularization is a great way to reduce overfitting.

## Regularization

Regularization is a way to constrain the model to make it simpler. This is done by adding a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term is based on the model parameters. The most common regularization techniques are:

1. Ridge Regression
2. Lasso Regression
