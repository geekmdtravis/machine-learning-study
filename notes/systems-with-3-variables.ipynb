We determine the singularity without a solution by looking at the determinant of the coefficient matrix. If the determinant is zero, the system is singular and has no solution. If the determinant is non-zero, the system is non-singular and has a solution. And, without considering the determinant, you can see that the system is complete and non-singular by setting the constants to zero and solving the equations.\n",

    "A system of linear equations with 2 variables can be represented as a line on a 2-dimensional graph. A system of linear equations with 3 variables can be represented as a plane on a 3-dimensional graph. As such, that 3-variable system can not only have a point of intersection, but also a line of intersection or no intersection at all. So, systems for 3 variable systems can have no solution (singular), a point solution (non-singular), a line of solutions (singular), or an infinite number of solutions (singular). In contrast, a singular system for a 2-variable system can only have a point solution (non-singular), no solution or an infinite number of solutions (both singular).\n"
